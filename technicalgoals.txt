Your next section should clearly provide context and guidance for developers or future team members who'll build upon your work. A suitable next section would be:

ðŸš§ Technical Goals and Design Decisions

This section will give clear visibility into the core goals, reasoning behind architectural decisions, and technical choices made in implementing the Gamification Layer.

Technical Goals

Implement a robust user engagement tracking system that integrates smoothly with existing InfraSight workflows.

Provide a scalable mechanism to handle user activity tracking without significantly impacting system resources.

Maintain data-driven configurations, enabling quick adjustments without frequent code changes or redeployments.

Ensure accurate and timezone-aware reward logic suitable for a geographically dispersed user base.


Key Architectural Decisions

MongoDB-Based Configuration:
Storing all gamification-related weights and parameters in MongoDB ensures flexibility, enabling easy adjustments by administrators without downtime.

Batch Job Approach:
Utilizing nightly batch processing jobs reduces real-time system load and provides robust historical data handling capabilities. It allows retrospective point recalculations if business rules or scoring logic changes.

Separate Auditing (PointsLog Collection):
Maintaining a detailed log collection (points_log) ensures comprehensive auditability of awarded points and simplifies troubleshooting.

REST API-First Design:
Clearly defined RESTful APIs support seamless frontend integration, ensure separation of concerns, and simplify future extensions or frontend enhancements.


Technology Choices

Component	Choice	Reasoning

Backend Framework	Java 11, Spring Boot	Standardized stack for maintainability & performance.
Database	MongoDB	Flexible schema, rapid configuration, scalability.
Frontend	React, Material UI	Consistent UI, responsive components.
Scheduling & Batch Jobs	Spring @Scheduled Tasks	Simplicity, reliable batch execution.
Security	Bearer Token Authentication (JWT/OAuth)	Enterprise-grade security practices.
Monitoring	Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer	Observability, real-time monitoring.
